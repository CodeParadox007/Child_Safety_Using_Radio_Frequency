# Introduction  
In this study, a comprehensive system has been developed featuring real-time GPS tracking, customizable safety range selection, and active monitoring via an Android application â€” all functioning without internet dependency. The system enables parents to define a specific geographic area considered safe for their child, offering a personalized and flexible monitoring solution. Additionally, a buzzer alert system has been integrated to enhance safety by providing immediate audible notifications when the child moves beyond the designated safe zone.
